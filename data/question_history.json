    "question": "give me all the dates from the document and show them in table",
    "answer": "Analyzing the provided structured data, I will extract the dates mentioned within the text. Dates can often be presented in various formats, and I will compile them into a table format for clarity.\n\nHere is a summary of dates found in the documents:\n\n| Document Number | Date Mentioned                                     |\n|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| Document 4       | 20                                                 |\n| Document 26      | 23rd July 2020                                    |\n| Document 24      | Date DD-MM-YYYY                                   |\n| Document 19      | Dated this.........................................|\n| Document 45      | Dated this.........................................|\n| Document 59      | Dated this.........................................|\n\n### Explanation of Findings:\n1. **Document 4**: The date appears in a placeholder format as \"20\", indicating that it was meant to be filled in by the responder.\n2. **Document 26**: The specific date \"23rd July 2020\" is directly mentioned in reference to an office memorandum.\n3. **Document 24**: The phrase \"Date DD-MM-YYYY\" serves as a placeholder for the actual date.\n4. **Document 19**: The phrase \"Dated this...\" is a standard closing line indicating where the date is to be inserted by the signer.\n5. **Document 45**: Similar to Document 19, it includes a placeholder for the date.\n6. **Document 59**: This also contains a placeholder for the date, indicating that the specific date will be filled out by the authorized signatory.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe extracted dates are mostly placeholders or specific to the document context, showing a standard format used in formal documents. The actual dates are limited, with \"23rd July 2020\" being the only specific date provided. Other mentions are either incomplete or intended to be filled in, indicating that the documents are designed for completion by the bidder or respondent. \n\nIf you need further analysis on specific dates or more context around these entries, feel free to ask!",
