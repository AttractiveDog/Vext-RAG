All dates if not specified to be applicable from the date of the RFP.\",\"The technical bids of only those bidders who qualify the above-mentioned eligibility criteria will be evaluated. The Technical Proposal will be evaluated for technical suitability as per Annexure 09. After qualifying the eligibility criteria, the evaluation will be a three-stage process. The stages are:\",\"The technical evaluation and the commercial evaluation shall have the weightage of $70 \\\\%$ and $30 \\\\%$ respectively and this weightage shall be considered for arriving at the successful bidder.

With Bank's CBS, With Bank's IB/MB, With CRM, With Complaint Management System, With SMS \\\\& email Gateway. Proof: Supporting document to be annexed / To be demonstrated During presentation.\",\"The commercial bids of only those bidders who qualify in both eligibility and technical evaluation will be opened. The date for opening of the commercial bid would be communicated separately to the technically eligible Bidders. The commercial bids submitted by Bidders will be evaluated based on discounted total cost of ownership. The discount rate will be used @ $10 \\\\%$. The key considerations of the TCO would be the total payouts for entire project through the contract period, discounted at $10 \\\\%$ to arrive at the present value of the future cash outflows. Accordingly the L1 (Lowest Bidder) would be arrived at. The calculation performed by the Bank in this regard is as follows:\",\"Any component / service for which the payment is a One Time Cost the NPV cost of the equipment / service for that year will be considered and the relevant year's NPV cost will be added as part of Present Value calculation for that year. Further the payment of the OTC component / services is not recurring in nature hence the present value for that component / services will be considered in the year of purchase only and not in subsequent years. The decision of the Bank shall be final and binding on all the bidders to this document. The Bank reserves the right to accept or reject an offer without assigning any reason whatsoever. The bidder is expected not to add any conditions / deviations in the commercial bid. Any such conditions / deviations may make the bid liable for disqualification.\",\"On the basis of the combined weighted score for technical and commercial evaluation, the bidders shall be ranked in terms of the total score obtained. The proposal obtaining the highest total combined score in evaluation of quality and cost will be ranked as $\\\\mathrm{H}-1$ followed by the proposals securing lesser marks as $\\\\mathrm{H}-2, \\\\mathrm{H}-3$ etc. The proposal securing the highest combined marks and ranked $\\\\mathrm{H}-1$ shall be recommended for award of contract. As an example, the following procedure can be followed: A score (S) will be calculated for all qualified bidders using the following formula:\",\"$$ \\\\frac{C_{\\\\text {low }}}{C} \\\\mathbf{X 1 0 0}+\\\\mathbf{T}(\\\\mathbf{1}-\\\\mathbf{X}) $$\",\"C stands for discounted rate arrived basis of commercial evaluation; Clow stands for the lowest discounted rate arrived basis of commercial evaluation.\",\"बैंक ऑफ बड़ोदर Bank of Baroda T stands for technical evaluation score and $\\\\mathbf{X}$ is equal to 0.30 .\",\"In the above example, Clow is 100. In the above example, CCC, with the highest score becomes the successful bidder. In case of more than one bidder with equal highest score (S) upto three decimal, then number of decimal will be increased. The decision of the Bank shall be final and binding on all the bidders to this document. The Bank reserves the right to accept or reject an offer without assigning any reason whatsoever The proposal of H1 (Highest Bidder in Weighted Evaluation) shall be recommended for award of contract.\",\"a. In the event the Bank has not asked for any quotes for alternative prices, and the bidder furnishes the alternative price in the Bidder's financial bid, the higher of the prices will be taken for calculating and arriving at the Total Cost of Ownership. However, payment by the Bank will be made at the lower price. The Bank in this case may also reject the offer outright. b. In the event optional prices are not quoted by the bidder, for items where such prices are a must and required to be quoted for, the highest price quoted by any of the participating Bidder will be taken as the costs, for such alternatives and also for arriving at the Total Cost of Ownership for the purpose of evaluation of the Bidder. The same item has to be supplied by the Bidder free of cost c. The bidder is requested to quote in Indian Rupee (INR). Bids in currencies other than INR would not be considered. The date for opening of price bids would be communicated separately to the successful bidders post the completion of the technical evaluation d. The prices and other terms offered by bidders must be firm for an acceptance period of 180 days from the opening of the commercial bid. e. In case of any variation (upward or down ward) in Government levies / taxes / cess / duties etc. which has been included as part of the price will be borne by the bidder. Variation would also include the introduction of any new tax / cess/ duty, etc provided that the benefit or burden of other taxes quoted separately as part of the commercial bid like GST and any taxes introduced instead of GST and levies associated to GST or any new taxes introduced after the submission of bidder's\",\"proposal shall be passed on or adjusted to the Bank. If the Bidder makes any conditional or vague offers, without conforming to these guidelines, Bank will treat the prices quoted as in conformity with these guidelines and proceed accordingly. Necessary documentary evidence should be produced for having paid any tax/cess/duty, if applicable, and or other applicable levies. f. If any Tax authorities of any state, including, Local authorities like Corporation, Municipality etc. or any Government authority or Statutory or autonomous or such other authority imposes any tax, charge or levy or any cess / charge other than GST and if the Bank has to pay the same for any of the items or supplies made here under by the bidder, for any reason including the delay or failure or inability of the bidder to make payment for the same, the Bank has to be reimbursed such amounts paid, on being intimated to the Bidder along with the documentary evidence. If the Bidder does not reimburse the amount within a fortnight, the Bank shall adjust the amount out of the payments due to the Bidder from the Bank along with the interest calculated at commercial rate. g.

In the event of any deviations from the requirements of these documents, the bidder must make good the same at no extra costs to the Bank, in order to achieve the desired service levels as well as meeting the requirements of these documents.

The date for opening of the commercial bid would be communicated separately to the technically eligible Bidders. The commercial bids submitted by Bidders will be evaluated based on discounted total cost of ownership. The discount rate will be used @ $10 \\\\%$. The key considerations of the TCO would be the total payouts for entire project through the contract period, discounted at $10 \\\\%$ to arrive at the present value of the future cash outflows. Accordingly the L1 (Lowest Bidder) would be arrived at. The calculation performed by the Bank in this regard is as follows:\",\"Any component / service for which the payment is a One Time Cost the NPV cost of the equipment / service for that year will be considered and the relevant year's NPV cost will be added as part of Present Value calculation for that year.

As an example, the following procedure can be followed: A score (S) will be calculated for all qualified bidders using the following formula:\",\"$$ \\\\frac{C_{\\\\text {low }}}{C} \\\\mathbf{X 1 0 0}+\\\\mathbf{T}(\\\\mathbf{1}-\\\\mathbf{X}) $$\",\"C stands for discounted rate arrived basis of commercial evaluation; Clow stands for the lowest discounted rate arrived basis of commercial evaluation.\",\"बैंक ऑफ बड़ोदर Bank of Baroda T stands for technical evaluation score and $\\\\mathbf{X}$ is equal to 0.30 .\",\"In the above example, Clow is 100.

In the event optional prices are not quoted by the bidder, for items where such prices are a must and required to be quoted for, the highest price quoted by any of the participating Bidder will be taken as the costs, for such alternatives and also for arriving at the Total Cost of Ownership for the purpose of evaluation of the Bidder.
