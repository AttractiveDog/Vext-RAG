    "question": "what are all the important dates in the table?",
    "answer": "Based on the provided context, I was unable to find a specific table or chart that lists all the important dates. However, I can suggest some possible locations where the important dates might be mentioned.\n\nIn Document 31, there is a table that mentions some dates, but it does not explicitly state that they are important dates. The table is as follows:\n\n|  n | Application Money | \"Not Applicable\"  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  5 | Eligibility Cum Technical Bid Opening Date | 3:30 PM on 27th May, 2022\n|  6 | Commercial Bid | The commercial bids of only those Bidders who qualify in both eligibility and technical evaluation will be opened. The date for opening of the commercial bid would be communicated separately to the technically eligible Bidders.  |\n\nAdditionally, in Document 39, there is a mention of important dates in the context of the RFP process, but it does not provide a comprehensive list of all important dates.\n\nTo find the important dates, I would recommend searching through all the documents, especially those related to the RFP process, such as Documents 1, 2, 3, and 39. It is possible that the important dates are scattered throughout these documents, and a thorough search is necessary to compile a complete list.\n\nIn conclusion, while I was unable to find a specific table or chart that lists all the important dates, I suggest searching through the relevant documents, especially those related to the RFP process, to find the necessary information.",

It states that \"Mission 2 (Digital Skeptic): The analysis pinpoints subtle biases, the 'red flags' are insightful, and the verification questions are sharp and actionable.\" (Document 6).\n\nDocument 13 provides more context about the Digital Skeptic mission. It explains that the goal is to perform a \"skeptical analysis\" of a news article, highlighting claims, analyzing language, and arming the reader with questions to ask. The program should produce a \"Critical Analysis Report\" in Markdown format, containing sections such as \"Core Claims\", \"Language & Tone Analysis\", \"Potential Red Flags\", and \"Verification Questions\" (Document 13).\n\nIn summary, the second mission, also known as the Digital Skeptic, involves analyzing a news article to identify potential biases, red flags, and claims, and providing a critical analysis report to help readers evaluate the article's credibility.

The actual dates are limited, with \"23rd July 2020\" being the only specific date provided. Other mentions are either incomplete or intended to be filled in, indicating that the documents are designed for completion by the bidder or respondent. \n\nIf you need further analysis on specific dates or more context around these entries, feel free to ask!",
