# AI Service Improvements for Better Source Utilization

## Problem Identified
The AI service was fetching relevant sources but not using them to generate answers. Specifically, when asked about "executive AI pricing", it would say "the context doesn't contain information" even though pricing data was available in the sources.

Additionally, the system struggled with fetching data from tables and graphical forms, even though Mistral OCR processes them thoroughly.

## Root Causes
1. **Weak system prompt**: The original prompt was too generic and didn't strongly emphasize using source information
2. **High temperature**: 0.7 temperature made responses too creative and less focused on source material
3. **Limited search results**: Default topK of 5 might miss relevant documents
4. **Poor context formatting**: Simple document formatting made it hard for AI to parse information
5. **No query expansion**: Search queries weren't broad enough to find related information
6. **Basic structured data processing**: Tables and charts were processed but not effectively utilized
7. **No specialized handling**: No distinction between regular questions and structured data questions

## Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced System Prompt (`src/services/aiService.js`)
- Added explicit instructions to use source information even for imperfect matches
- Emphasized looking for related terms and synonyms
- Added specific guidance for pricing questions
- Required citation of document numbers
- Added instructions to explain connections between similar services

### 2. Improved User Prompt
- Added specific instructions for pricing questions
- Emphasized using related information when exact matches aren't found
- Required detailed answers with citations

### 3. Lowered Temperature
- Changed from 0.7 to 0.3 for more focused, factual responses
- Makes AI more likely to stick to source material

### 4. Enhanced Context Formatting
- Added structured formatting with clear document boundaries
- Included metadata in context for better understanding
- Made document separation more explicit

### 5. Query Expansion (`src/routes/api.js`)
- Added automatic query expansion for pricing-related questions
- Searches for additional terms like "pricing cost price fee rate"
- Merges and deduplicates results
- Sorts by relevance

### 6. Increased Default Search Results
- Changed default topK from 5 to 10
- Provides more context for AI to work with

### 7. Added Debugging
- Added logging of search results to help diagnose issues
- Shows what documents are being retrieved

### 8. Enhanced Structured Data Processing (`src/services/ocrService.js`)
- **Improved table extraction**: Enhanced detection of various table formats (markdown, space-separated)
- **Chart and graphics detection**: Added recognition of charts, graphs, and visual data
- **Better structure preservation**: Maintains table headers, rows, and data relationships
- **Enhanced metadata**: Stores structured data with proper formatting and relationships

### 9. Specialized AI Handling for Structured Data (`src/services/aiService.js`)
- **Question classification**: Automatically detects if a question is about structured data
- **Specialized prompts**: Different prompts for tables/charts vs regular questions
- **Enhanced context formatting**: Tables and charts are prominently displayed in context
- **Structured data analysis**: AI is specifically instructed to analyze tables, charts, and numerical data

### 10. Enhanced Search for Structured Data (`src/routes/api.js`)
- **Structured data detection**: Identifies questions about tables, charts, numbers, etc.
- **Enhanced search queries**: Adds relevant keywords for better retrieval
- **Metadata-based search**: Searches for documents with tables/charts in metadata
- **Priority scoring**: Gives higher priority to documents with structured data

## Expected Results
With these improvements, the AI should now:
- Use pricing information from sources even when exact product names don't match
- Explain connections between similar services (e.g., "meeting bot" vs "executive AI")
- Cite specific document numbers in responses
- Provide more comprehensive answers based on available context
- Be more focused on factual information from sources
- **Effectively analyze and answer questions about tables and charts**
- **Extract specific values and data points from structured information**
- **Identify trends and patterns in numerical data**
- **Compare data across different tables and charts**
- **Provide detailed analysis of graphical information**

## Testing
Created `test_improvements.js` to verify the improvements work with mock data similar to the original scenario.
Created `test_structured_data.js` to verify structured data improvements work correctly.

## Files Modified
- `src/services/aiService.js` - Enhanced prompts, structured data detection, and context formatting
- `src/routes/api.js` - Added query expansion, debugging, and structured data search
- `src/services/ocrService.js` - Enhanced table and chart extraction
- `test_structured_data.js` - New test suite for structured data improvements

## Structured Data Keywords
The system now recognizes questions about:
- Tables, charts, graphs, figures
- Data, datasets, spreadsheets
- Numbers, values, statistics
- Percentages, totals, averages
- Comparisons, trends, patterns
- Columns, rows, cells
